    <h2>Mark</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Mark.1</h3>
    [<b>1</b>] The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
    <br />[<b>2</b>] As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, "Behold, I send my
    messenger before thy face,<br />
    who shall prepare thy way;<br />[<b>3</b>] the voice of one crying in the
    wilderness:<br />
    Prepare the way of the Lord,<br />
    make his paths straight -- "<br />[<b>4</b>] John the baptizer appeared in
    the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of
    sins. <br />[<b>5</b>] And there went out to him all the country of Judea,
    and all the people of Jerusalem; and they were baptized by him in the river
    Jordan, confessing their sins. <br />[<b>6</b>] Now John was clothed with
    camel's hair, and had a leather girdle around his waist, and ate locusts and
    wild honey. <br />[<b>7</b>] And he preached, saying, "After me comes he who
    is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down
    and untie. <br />[<b>8</b>] I have baptized you with water; but he will
    baptize you with the Holy Spirit." <br />[<b>9</b>]
    <p>
      In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John
      in the Jordan.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>10</b>] And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw
    the heavens opened and the Spirit descending upon him like a dove;
    <br />[<b>11</b>] and a voice came from heaven, "Thou art my beloved Son;
    with thee I am well pleased." <br />[<b>12</b>]
    <p>The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness.</p>
    <br />[<b>13</b>] And he was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan;
    and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him.
    <br />[<b>14</b>]
    <p>
      Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel
      of God,
    </p>
    <br />[<b>15</b>] and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God
    is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospel." <br />[<b>16</b>]
    <p>
      And passing along by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the
      brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they were fishermen.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>17</b>] And Jesus said to them, "Follow me and I will make you
    become fishers of men." <br />[<b>18</b>] And immediately they left their
    nets and followed him. <br />[<b>19</b>] And going on a little farther, he
    saw James the son of Zeb'edee and John his brother, who were in their boat
    mending the nets. <br />[<b>20</b>] And immediately he called them; and they
    left their father Zeb'edee in the boat with the hired servants, and followed
    him. <br />[<b>21</b>]
    <p>
      And they went into Caper'na-um; and immediately on the sabbath he entered
      the synagogue and taught.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>22</b>] And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught
    them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes. <br />[<b>23</b>] And
    immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit;
    <br />[<b>24</b>] and he cried out, "What have you to do with us, Jesus of
    Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of
    God." <br />[<b>25</b>] But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come
    out of him!" <br />[<b>26</b>] And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and
    crying with a loud voice, came out of him. <br />[<b>27</b>] And they were
    all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this?
    A new teaching! With authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and
    they obey him." <br />[<b>28</b>] And at once his fame spread everywhere
    throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee. <br />[<b>29</b>]
    <p>
      And immediately he left the synagogue, and entered the house of Simon and
      Andrew, with James and John.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>30</b>] Now Simon's mother-in-law lay sick with a fever, and
    immediately they told him of her. <br />[<b>31</b>] And he came and took her
    by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her; and she served them.
    <br />[<b>32</b>]
    <p>
      That evening, at sundown, they brought to him all who were sick or
      possessed with demons.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>33</b>] And the whole city was gathered together about the door.
    <br />[<b>34</b>] And he healed many who were sick with various diseases,
    and cast out many demons; and he would not permit the demons to speak,
    because they knew him. <br />[<b>35</b>]
    <p>
      And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose and went out to a
      lonely place, and there he prayed.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>36</b>] And Simon and those who were with him pursued him,
    <br />[<b>37</b>] and they found him and said to him, "Every one is
    searching for you." <br />[<b>38</b>] And he said to them, "Let us go on to
    the next towns, that I may preach there also; for that is why I came out."
    <br />[<b>39</b>] And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their
    synagogues and casting out demons. <br />[<b>40</b>]
    <p>
      And a leper came to him beseeching him, and kneeling said to him, "If you
      will, you can make me clean."
    </p>
    <br />[<b>41</b>] Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched
    him, and said to him, "I will; be clean." <br />[<b>42</b>] And immediately
    the leprosy left him, and he was made clean. <br />[<b>43</b>] And he
    sternly charged him, and sent him away at once, <br />[<b>44</b>] and said
    to him, "See that you say nothing to any one; but go, show yourself to the
    priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to
    the people." <br />[<b>45</b>] But he went out and began to talk freely
    about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter
    a town, but was out in the country; and people came to him from every
    quarter. <br />
    <hr />
    <h3>Mark.2</h3>
    [<b>1</b>]
    <p>
      And when he returned to Caper'na-um after some days, it was reported that
      he was at home.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>2</b>] And many were gathered together, so that there was no
    longer room for them, not even about the door; and he was preaching the word
    to them. <br />[<b>3</b>] And they came, bringing to him a paralytic carried
    by four men. <br />[<b>4</b>] And when they could not get near him because
    of the crowd, they removed the roof above him; and when they had made an
    opening, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic lay.
    <br />[<b>5</b>] And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic,
    "My son, your sins are forgiven." <br />[<b>6</b>] Now some of the scribes
    were sitting there, questioning in their hearts, <br />[<b>7</b>] "Why does
    this man speak thus? It is blasphemy! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
    <br />[<b>8</b>] And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they
    thus questioned within themselves, said to them, "Why do you question thus
    in your hearts? <br />[<b>9</b>] Which is easier, to say to the paralytic,
    `Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, `Rise, take up your pallet and walk'?
    <br />[<b>10</b>] But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on
    earth to forgive sins" -- he said to the paralytic -- <br />[<b>11</b>] "I
    say to you, rise, take up your pallet and go home." <br />[<b>12</b>] And he
    rose, and immediately took up the pallet and went out before them all; so
    that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, "We never saw anything
    like this!" <br />[<b>13</b>]
    <p>
      He went out again beside the sea; and all the crowd gathered about him,
      and he taught them.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>14</b>] And as he passed on, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus
    sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, "Follow me." And he rose and
    followed him. <br />[<b>15</b>]
    <p>
      And as he sat at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were
      sitting with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many who followed
      him.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>16</b>] And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he
    was eating with sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, "Why does
    he eat with tax collectors and sinners?" <br />[<b>17</b>] And when Jesus
    heard it, he said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician,
    but those who are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners."
    <br />[<b>18</b>]
    <p>
      Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting; and people came and
      said to him, "Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees
      fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
    </p>
    <br />[<b>19</b>] And Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests fast while
    the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them,
    they cannot fast. <br />[<b>20</b>] The days will come, when the bridegroom
    is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.
    <br />[<b>21</b>] No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment;
    if he does, the patch tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse
    tear is made. <br />[<b>22</b>] And no one puts new wine into old wineskins;
    if he does, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost, and so are
    the skins; but new wine is for fresh skins." <br />[<b>23</b>]
    <p>
      One sabbath he was going through the grainfields; and as they made their
      way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>24</b>] And the Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing
    what is not lawful on the sabbath?" <br />[<b>25</b>] And he said to them,
    "Have you never read what David did, when he was in need and was hungry, he
    and those who were with him: <br />[<b>26</b>] how he entered the house of
    God, when Abi'athar was high priest, and ate the bread of the Presence,
    which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to
    those who were with him?" <br />[<b>27</b>] And he said to them, "The
    sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath; <br />[<b>28</b>] so the
    Son of man is lord even of the sabbath." <br />
    <hr />
    <h3>Mark.3</h3>
    [<b>1</b>]
    <p>
      Again he entered the synagogue, and a man was there who had a withered
      hand.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>2</b>] And they watched him, to see whether he would heal him on
    the sabbath, so that they might accuse him. <br />[<b>3</b>] And he said to
    the man who had the withered hand, "Come here." <br />[<b>4</b>] And he said
    to them, "Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life
    or to kill?" But they were silent. <br />[<b>5</b>] And he looked around at
    them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man,
    "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
    <br />[<b>6</b>] The Pharisees went out, and immediately held counsel with
    the Hero'di-ans against him, how to destroy him. <br />[<b>7</b>]
    <p>
      Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from
      Galilee followed; also from Judea
    </p>
    <br />[<b>8</b>] and Jerusalem and Idume'a and from beyond the Jordan and
    from about Tyre and Sidon a great multitude, hearing all that he did, came
    to him. <br />[<b>9</b>] And he told his disciples to have a boat ready for
    him because of the crowd, lest they should crush him; <br />[<b>10</b>] for
    he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed upon him to touch
    him. <br />[<b>11</b>] And whenever the unclean spirits beheld him, they
    fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God."
    <br />[<b>12</b>] And he strictly ordered them not to make him known.
    <br />[<b>13</b>]
    <p>
      And he went up on the mountain, and called to him those whom he desired;
      and they came to him.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>14</b>] And he appointed twelve, to be with him, and to be sent
    out to preach <br />[<b>15</b>] and have authority to cast out demons:
    <br />[<b>16</b>] Simon whom he surnamed Peter; <br />[<b>17</b>] James the
    son of Zeb'edee and John the brother of James, whom he surnamed Bo-aner'ges,
    that is, sons of thunder; <br />[<b>18</b>] Andrew, and Philip, and
    Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and
    Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean, <br />[<b>19</b>] and Judas Iscariot,
    who betrayed him.
    <p>Then he went home;</p>
    <br />[<b>20</b>] and the crowd came together again, so that they could not
    even eat. <br />[<b>21</b>] And when his family heard it, they went out to
    seize him, for people were saying, "He is beside himself." <br />[<b>22</b>]
    And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by
    Be-el'zebul, and by the prince of demons he casts out the demons."
    <br />[<b>23</b>] And he called them to him, and said to them in parables,
    "How can Satan cast out Satan? <br />[<b>24</b>] If a kingdom is divided
    against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. <br />[<b>25</b>] And if a house
    is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.
    <br />[<b>26</b>] And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided,
    he cannot stand, but is coming to an end. <br />[<b>27</b>] But no one can
    enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the
    strong man; then indeed he may plunder his house. <br />[<b>28</b>]
    <p>
      "Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and
      whatever blasphemies they utter;
    </p>
    <br />[<b>29</b>] but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has
    forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin" -- <br />[<b>30</b>] for they
    had said, "He has an unclean spirit." <br />[<b>31</b>]
    <p>
      And his mother and his brothers came; and standing outside they sent to
      him and called him.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>32</b>] And a crowd was sitting about him; and they said to him,
    "Your mother and your brothers are outside, asking for you."
    <br />[<b>33</b>] And he replied, "Who are my mother and my brothers?"
    <br />[<b>34</b>] And looking around on those who sat about him, he said,
    "Here are my mother and my brothers! <br />[<b>35</b>] Whoever does the will
    of God is my brother, and sister, and mother." <br />
    <hr />
    <h3>Mark.4</h3>
    [<b>1</b>]
    <p>
      Again he began to teach beside the sea. And a very large crowd gathered
      about him, so that he got into a boat and sat in it on the sea; and the
      whole crowd was beside the sea on the land.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>2</b>] And he taught them many things in parables, and in his
    teaching he said to them: <br />[<b>3</b>] "Listen! A sower went out to sow.
    <br />[<b>4</b>] And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the
    birds came and devoured it. <br />[<b>5</b>] Other seed fell on rocky
    ground, where it had not much soil, and immediately it sprang up, since it
    had no depth of soil; <br />[<b>6</b>] and when the sun rose it was
    scorched, and since it had no root it withered away. <br />[<b>7</b>] Other
    seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded
    no grain. <br />[<b>8</b>] And other seeds fell into good soil and brought
    forth grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold
    and a hundredfold." <br />[<b>9</b>] And he said, "He who has ears to hear,
    let him hear." <br />[<b>10</b>]
    <p>
      And when he was alone, those who were about him with the twelve asked him
      concerning the parables.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>11</b>] And he said to them, "To you has been given the secret of
    the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables;
    <br />[<b>12</b>] so that they may indeed see but not perceive, and may
    indeed hear but not understand; lest they should turn again, and be
    forgiven." <br />[<b>13</b>] And he said to them, "Do you not understand
    this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?
    <br />[<b>14</b>] The sower sows the word. <br />[<b>15</b>] And these are
    the ones along the path, where the word is sown; when they hear, Satan
    immediately comes and takes away the word which is sown in them.
    <br />[<b>16</b>] And these in like manner are the ones sown upon rocky
    ground, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy;
    <br />[<b>17</b>] and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a
    while; then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word,
    immediately they fall away. <br />[<b>18</b>] And others are the ones sown
    among thorns; they are those who hear the word, <br />[<b>19</b>] but the
    cares of the world, and the delight in riches, and the desire for other
    things, enter in and choke the word, and it proves unfruitful.
    <br />[<b>20</b>] But those that were sown upon the good soil are the ones
    who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirtyfold and sixtyfold and
    a hundredfold." <br />[<b>21</b>]
    <p>
      And he said to them, "Is a lamp brought in to be put under a bushel, or
      under a bed, and not on a stand?
    </p>
    <br />[<b>22</b>] For there is nothing hid, except to be made manifest; nor
    is anything secret, except to come to light. <br />[<b>23</b>] If any man
    has ears to hear, let him hear." <br />[<b>24</b>] And he said to them,
    "Take heed what you hear; the measure you give will be the measure you get,
    and still more will be given you. <br />[<b>25</b>] For to him who has will
    more be given; and from him who has not, even what he has will be taken
    away." <br />[<b>26</b>]
    <p>
      And he said, "The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed upon
      the ground,
    </p>
    <br />[<b>27</b>] and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed
    should sprout and grow, he knows not how. <br />[<b>28</b>] The earth
    produces of itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in
    the ear. <br />[<b>29</b>] But when the grain is ripe, at once he puts in
    the sickle, because the harvest has come." <br />[<b>30</b>]
    <p>
      And he said, "With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable
      shall we use for it?
    </p>
    <br />[<b>31</b>] It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when sown upon
    the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth; <br />[<b>32</b>] yet
    when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs, and puts
    forth large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its
    shade." <br />[<b>33</b>]
    <p>
      With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to
      hear it;
    </p>
    <br />[<b>34</b>] he did not speak to them without a parable, but privately
    to his own disciples he explained everything. <br />[<b>35</b>]
    <p>
      On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let us go across to
      the other side."
    </p>
    <br />[<b>36</b>] And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the
    boat, just as he was. And other boats were with him. <br />[<b>37</b>] And a
    great storm of wind arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the
    boat was already filling. <br />[<b>38</b>] But he was in the stern, asleep
    on the cushion; and they woke him and said to him, "Teacher, do you not care
    if we perish?" <br />[<b>39</b>] And he awoke and rebuked the wind, and said
    to the sea, "Peace! Be still!" And the wind ceased, and there was a great
    calm. <br />[<b>40</b>] He said to them, "Why are you afraid? Have you no
    faith?" <br />[<b>41</b>] And they were filled with awe, and said to one
    another, "Who then is this, that even wind and sea obey him?" <br />
    <hr />
    <h3>Mark.5</h3>
    [<b>1</b>]
    <p>
      They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Ger'asenes.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>2</b>] And when he had come out of the boat, there met him out of
    the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, <br />[<b>3</b>] who lived among the
    tombs; and no one could bind him any more, even with a chain;
    <br />[<b>4</b>] for he had often been bound with fetters and chains, but
    the chains he wrenched apart, and the fetters he broke in pieces; and no one
    had the strength to subdue him. <br />[<b>5</b>] Night and day among the
    tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out, and bruising himself
    with stones. <br />[<b>6</b>] And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and
    worshiped him; <br />[<b>7</b>] and crying out with a loud voice, he said,
    "What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you
    by God, do not torment me." <br />[<b>8</b>] For he had said to him, "Come
    out of the man, you unclean spirit!" <br />[<b>9</b>] And Jesus asked him,
    "What is your name?" He replied, "My name is Legion; for we are many."
    <br />[<b>10</b>] And he begged him eagerly not to send them out of the
    country. <br />[<b>11</b>] Now a great herd of swine was feeding there on
    the hillside; <br />[<b>12</b>] and they begged him, "Send us to the swine,
    let us enter them." <br />[<b>13</b>] So he gave them leave. And the unclean
    spirits came out, and entered the swine; and the herd, numbering about two
    thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and were drowned in the
    sea. <br />[<b>14</b>]
    <p>
      The herdsmen fled, and told it in the city and in the country. And people
      came to see what it was that had happened.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>15</b>] And they came to Jesus, and saw the demoniac sitting
    there, clothed and in his right mind, the man who had had the legion; and
    they were afraid. <br />[<b>16</b>] And those who had seen it told what had
    happened to the demoniac and to the swine. <br />[<b>17</b>] And they began
    to beg Jesus to depart from their neighborhood. <br />[<b>18</b>] And as he
    was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons begged
    him that he might be with him. <br />[<b>19</b>] But he refused, and said to
    him, "Go home to your friends, and tell them how much the Lord has done for
    you, and how he has had mercy on you." <br />[<b>20</b>] And he went away
    and began to proclaim in the Decap'olis how much Jesus had done for him; and
    all men marveled. <br />[<b>21</b>]
    <p>
      And when Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great
      crowd gathered about him; and he was beside the sea.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>22</b>] Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Ja'irus by
    name; and seeing him, he fell at his feet, <br />[<b>23</b>] and besought
    him, saying, "My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your
    hands on her, so that she may be made well, and live." <br />[<b>24</b>] And
    he went with him.
    <p>And a great crowd followed him and thronged about him.</p>
    <br />[<b>25</b>] And there was a woman who had had a flow of blood for
    twelve years, <br />[<b>26</b>] and who had suffered much under many
    physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better but rather
    grew worse. <br />[<b>27</b>] She had heard the reports about Jesus, and
    came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment. <br />[<b>28</b>]
    For she said, "If I touch even his garments, I shall be made well."
    <br />[<b>29</b>] And immediately the hemorrhage ceased; and she felt in her
    body that she was healed of her disease. <br />[<b>30</b>] And Jesus,
    perceiving in himself that power had gone forth from him, immediately turned
    about in the crowd, and said, "Who touched my garments?" <br />[<b>31</b>]
    And his disciples said to him, "You see the crowd pressing around you, and
    yet you say, `Who touched me?'" <br />[<b>32</b>] And he looked around to
    see who had done it. <br />[<b>33</b>] But the woman, knowing what had been
    done to her, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him, and told
    him the whole truth. <br />[<b>34</b>] And he said to her, "Daughter, your
    faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease."
    <br />[<b>35</b>]
    <p>
      While he was still speaking, there came from the ruler's house some who
      said, "Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?"
    </p>
    <br />[<b>36</b>] But ignoring what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of
    the synagogue, "Do not fear, only believe." <br />[<b>37</b>] And he allowed
    no one to follow him except Peter and James and John the brother of James.
    <br />[<b>38</b>] When they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue,
    he saw a tumult, and people weeping and wailing loudly. <br />[<b>39</b>]
    And when he had entered, he said to them, "Why do you make a tumult and
    weep? The child is not dead but sleeping." <br />[<b>40</b>] And they
    laughed at him. But he put them all outside, and took the child's father and
    mother and those who were with him, and went in where the child was.
    <br />[<b>41</b>] Taking her by the hand he said to her, "Tal'itha cu'mi";
    which means, "Little girl, I say to you, arise." <br />[<b>42</b>] And
    immediately the girl got up and walked (she was twelve years of age), and
    they were immediately overcome with amazement. <br />[<b>43</b>] And he
    strictly charged them that no one should know this, and told them to give
    her something to eat. <br />
    <hr />
    <h3>Mark.6</h3>
    [<b>1</b>]
    <p>
      He went away from there and came to his own country; and his disciples
      followed him.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>2</b>] And on the sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue; and
    many who heard him were astonished, saying, "Where did this man get all
    this? What is the wisdom given to him? What mighty works are wrought by his
    hands! <br />[<b>3</b>] Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and
    brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here
    with us?" And they took offense at him. <br />[<b>4</b>] And Jesus said to
    them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among
    his own kin, and in his own house." <br />[<b>5</b>] And he could do no
    mighty work there, except that he laid his hands upon a few sick people and
    healed them. <br />[<b>6</b>] And he marveled because of their unbelief.
    <p>And he went about among the villages teaching.</p>
    <br />[<b>7</b>]
    <p>
      And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them out two by two,
      and gave them authority over the unclean spirits.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>8</b>] He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a
    staff; no bread, no bag, no money in their belts; <br />[<b>9</b>] but to
    wear sandals and not put on two tunics. <br />[<b>10</b>] And he said to
    them, "Where you enter a house, stay there until you leave the place.
    <br />[<b>11</b>] And if any place will not receive you and they refuse to
    hear you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet for a
    testimony against them." <br />[<b>12</b>] So they went out and preached
    that men should repent. <br />[<b>13</b>] And they cast out many demons, and
    anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them. <br />[<b>14</b>]
    <p>
      King Herod heard of it; for Jesus' name had become known. Some said, "John
      the baptizer has been raised from the dead; that is why these powers are
      at work in him."
    </p>
    <br />[<b>15</b>] But others said, "It is Eli'jah." And others said, "It is
    a prophet, like one of the prophets of old." <br />[<b>16</b>] But when
    Herod heard of it he said, "John, whom I beheaded, has been raised."
    <br />[<b>17</b>] For Herod had sent and seized John, and bound him in
    prison for the sake of Hero'di-as, his brother Philip's wife; because he had
    married her. <br />[<b>18</b>] For John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for
    you to have your brother's wife." <br />[<b>19</b>] And Hero'di-as had a
    grudge against him, and wanted to kill him. But she could not,
    <br />[<b>20</b>] for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and
    holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he was much perplexed; and
    yet he heard him gladly. <br />[<b>21</b>] But an opportunity came when
    Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his courtiers and officers and the
    leading men of Galilee. <br />[<b>22</b>] For when Hero'di-as' daughter came
    in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests; and the king said to the
    girl, "Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will grant it." <br />[<b>23</b>]
    And he vowed to her, "Whatever you ask me, I will give you, even half of my
    kingdom." <br />[<b>24</b>] And she went out, and said to her mother, "What
    shall I ask?" And she said, "The head of John the baptizer."
    <br />[<b>25</b>] And she came in immediately with haste to the king, and
    asked, saying, "I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist
    on a platter." <br />[<b>26</b>] And the king was exceedingly sorry; but
    because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to
    her. <br />[<b>27</b>] And immediately the king sent a soldier of the guard
    and gave orders to bring his head. He went and beheaded him in the prison,
    <br />[<b>28</b>] and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the
    girl; and the girl gave it to her mother. <br />[<b>29</b>] When his
    disciples heard of it, they came and took his body, and laid it in a tomb.
    <br />[<b>30</b>]
    <p>
      The apostles returned to Jesus, and told him all that they had done and
      taught.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>31</b>] And he said to them, "Come away by yourselves to a lonely
    place, and rest a while." For many were coming and going, and they had no
    leisure even to eat. <br />[<b>32</b>] And they went away in the boat to a
    lonely place by themselves. <br />[<b>33</b>] Now many saw them going, and
    knew them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns, and got there
    ahead of them. <br />[<b>34</b>] As he went ashore he saw a great throng,
    and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a
    shepherd; and he began to teach them many things. <br />[<b>35</b>] And when
    it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, "This is a lonely place,
    and the hour is now late; <br />[<b>36</b>] send them away, to go into the
    country and villages round about and buy themselves something to eat."
    <br />[<b>37</b>] But he answered them, "You give them something to eat."
    And they said to him, "Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of
    bread, and give it to them to eat?" <br />[<b>38</b>] And he said to them,
    "How many loaves have you? Go and see." And when they had found out, they
    said, "Five, and two fish." <br />[<b>39</b>] Then he commanded them all to
    sit down by companies upon the green grass. <br />[<b>40</b>] So they sat
    down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties. <br />[<b>41</b>] And taking the
    five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke
    the loaves, and gave them to the disciples to set before the people; and he
    divided the two fish among them all. <br />[<b>42</b>] And they all ate and
    were satisfied. <br />[<b>43</b>] And they took up twelve baskets full of
    broken pieces and of the fish. <br />[<b>44</b>] And those who ate the
    loaves were five thousand men. <br />[<b>45</b>]
    <p>
      Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to
      the other side, to Beth-sa'ida, while he dismissed the crowd.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>46</b>] And after he had taken leave of them, he went up on the
    mountain to pray. <br />[<b>47</b>] And when evening came, the boat was out
    on the sea, and he was alone on the land. <br />[<b>48</b>] And he saw that
    they were making headway painfully, for the wind was against them. And about
    the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. He meant
    to pass by them, <br />[<b>49</b>] but when they saw him walking on the sea
    they thought it was a ghost, and cried out; <br />[<b>50</b>] for they all
    saw him, and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said,
    "Take heart, it is I; have no fear." <br />[<b>51</b>] And he got into the
    boat with them and the wind ceased. And they were utterly astounded,
    <br />[<b>52</b>] for they did not understand about the loaves, but their
    hearts were hardened. <br />[<b>53</b>]
    <p>
      And when they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennes'aret, and
      moored to the shore.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>54</b>] And when they got out of the boat, immediately the people
    recognized him, <br />[<b>55</b>] and ran about the whole neighborhood and
    began to bring sick people on their pallets to any place where they heard he
    was. <br />[<b>56</b>] And wherever he came, in villages, cities, or
    country, they laid the sick in the market places, and besought him that they
    might touch even the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched it were
    made well. <br />

    <h3>Mark.7</h3>
    [<b>1</b>]
    <p>
      Now when the Pharisees gathered together to him, with some of the scribes,
      who had come from Jerusalem,
    </p>
    <br />[<b>2</b>] they saw that some of his disciples ate with hands defiled,
    that is, unwashed. <br />[<b>3</b>] (For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, do
    not eat unless they wash their hands, observing the tradition of the elders;
    <br />[<b>4</b>] and when they come from the market place, they do not eat
    unless they purify themselves; and there are many other traditions which
    they observe, the washing of cups and pots and vessels of bronze.)
    <br />[<b>5</b>] And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, "Why do your
    disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with
    hands defiled?" <br />[<b>6</b>] And he said to them, "Well did Isaiah
    prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, `This people honors me with
    their lips,<br />
    but their heart is far from me;<br />[<b>7</b>] in vain do they worship
    me,<br />
    teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.'<br />[<b>8</b>] You leave the
    commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men." <br />[<b>9</b>]
    <p>
      And he said to them, "You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of
      God, in order to keep your tradition!
    </p>
    <br />[<b>10</b>] For Moses said, `Honor your father and your mother'; and,
    `He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him surely die';
    <br />[<b>11</b>] but you say, `If a man tells his father or his mother,
    What you would have gained from me is Corban' (that is, given to God) --
    <br />[<b>12</b>] then you no longer permit him to do anything for his
    father or mother, <br />[<b>13</b>] thus making void the word of God through
    your tradition which you hand on. And many such things you do."
    <br />[<b>14</b>]
    <p>
      And he called the people to him again, and said to them, "Hear me, all of
      you, and understand:
    </p>
    <br />[<b>15</b>] there is nothing outside a man which by going into him can
    defile him; but the things which come out of a man are what defile him."
    <br />[<b>17</b>] And when he had entered the house, and left the people,
    his disciples asked him about the parable. <br />[<b>18</b>] And he said to
    them, "Then are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever
    goes into a man from outside cannot defile him, <br />[<b>19</b>] since it
    enters, not his heart but his stomach, and so passes on?" (Thus he declared
    all foods clean.) <br />[<b>20</b>] And he said, "What comes out of a man is
    what defiles a man. <br />[<b>21</b>] For from within, out of the heart of
    man, come evil thoughts, fornication, theft, murder, adultery,
    <br />[<b>22</b>] coveting, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy,
    slander, pride, foolishness. <br />[<b>23</b>] All these evil things come
    from within, and they defile a man." <br />[<b>24</b>]
    <p>
      And from there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And
      he entered a house, and would not have any one know it; yet he could not
      be hid.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>25</b>] But immediately a woman, whose little daughter was
    possessed by an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell down at his
    feet. <br />[<b>26</b>] Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoeni'cian by
    birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter.
    <br />[<b>27</b>] And he said to her, "Let the children first be fed, for it
    is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
    <br />[<b>28</b>] But she answered him, "Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under
    the table eat the children's crumbs." <br />[<b>29</b>] And he said to her,
    "For this saying you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter."
    <br />[<b>30</b>] And she went home, and found the child lying in bed, and
    the demon gone. <br />[<b>31</b>]
    <p>
      Then he returned from the region of Tyre, and went through Sidon to the
      Sea of Galilee, through the region of the Decap'olis.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>32</b>] And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had an
    impediment in his speech; and they besought him to lay his hand upon him.
    <br />[<b>33</b>] And taking him aside from the multitude privately, he put
    his fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue;
    <br />[<b>34</b>] and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him,
    "Eph'phatha," that is, "Be opened." <br />[<b>35</b>] And his ears were
    opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly. <br />[<b>36</b>] And
    he charged them to tell no one; but the more he charged them, the more
    zealously they proclaimed it. <br />[<b>37</b>] And they were astonished
    beyond measure, saying, "He has done all things well; he even makes the deaf
    hear and the dumb speak." <br />
    <hr />
    <h3>Mark.8</h3>
    [<b>1</b>]
    <p>
      In those days, when again a great crowd had gathered, and they had nothing
      to eat, he called his disciples to him, and said to them,
    </p>
    <br />[<b>2</b>] "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been
    with me now three days, and have nothing to eat; <br />[<b>3</b>] and if I
    send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way; and some
    of them have come a long way." <br />[<b>4</b>] And his disciples answered
    him, "How can one feed these men with bread here in the desert?"
    <br />[<b>5</b>] And he asked them, "How many loaves have you?" They said,
    "Seven." <br />[<b>6</b>] And he commanded the crowd to sit down on the
    ground; and he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks he broke them
    and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them
    before the crowd. <br />[<b>7</b>] And they had a few small fish; and having
    blessed them, he commanded that these also should be set before them.
    <br />[<b>8</b>] And they ate, and were satisfied; and they took up the
    broken pieces left over, seven baskets full. <br />[<b>9</b>] And there were
    about four thousand people. <br />[<b>10</b>] And he sent them away; and
    immediately he got into the boat with his disciples, and went to the
    district of Dalmanu'tha. <br />[<b>11</b>]
    <p>
      The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign
      from heaven, to test him.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>12</b>] And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, "Why does
    this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign shall be given to
    this generation." <br />[<b>13</b>] And he left them, and getting into the
    boat again he departed to the other side. <br />[<b>14</b>]
    <p>
      Now they had forgotten to bring bread; and they had only one loaf with
      them in the boat.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>15</b>] And he cautioned them, saying, "Take heed, beware of the
    leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod." <br />[<b>16</b>] And they
    discussed it with one another, saying, "We have no bread." <br />[<b>17</b>]
    And being aware of it, Jesus said to them, "Why do you discuss the fact that
    you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts
    hardened? <br />[<b>18</b>] Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do
    you not hear? And do you not remember? <br />[<b>19</b>] When I broke the
    five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces
    did you take up?" They said to him, "Twelve." <br />[<b>20</b>] "And the
    seven for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you
    take up?" And they said to him, "Seven." <br />[<b>21</b>] And he said to
    them, "Do you not yet understand?" <br />[<b>22</b>]
    <p>
      And they came to Beth-sa'ida. And some people brought to him a blind man,
      and begged him to touch him.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>23</b>] And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of
    the village; and when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands upon him,
    he asked him, "Do you see anything?" <br />[<b>24</b>] And he looked up and
    said, "I see men; but they look like trees, walking." <br />[<b>25</b>] Then
    again he laid his hands upon his eyes; and he looked intently and was
    restored, and saw everything clearly. <br />[<b>26</b>] And he sent him away
    to his home, saying, "Do not even enter the village." <br />[<b>27</b>]
    <p>
      And Jesus went on with his disciples, to the villages of Caesare'a
      Philip'pi; and on the way he asked his disciples, "Who do men say that I
      am?"
    </p>
    <br />[<b>28</b>] And they told him, "John the Baptist; and others say,
    Eli'jah; and others one of the prophets." <br />[<b>29</b>] And he asked
    them, "But who do you say that I am?" Peter answered him, "You are the
    Christ." <br />[<b>30</b>] And he charged them to tell no one about him.
    <br />[<b>31</b>]
    <p>
      And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things,
      and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and
      be killed, and after three days rise again.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>32</b>] And he said this plainly. And Peter took him, and began to
    rebuke him. <br />[<b>33</b>] But turning and seeing his disciples, he
    rebuked Peter, and said, "Get behind me, Satan! For you are not on the side
    of God, but of men." <br />[<b>34</b>]
    <p>
      And he called to him the multitude with his disciples, and said to them,
      "If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his
      cross and follow me.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>35</b>] For whoever would save his life will lose it; and whoever
    loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it. <br />[<b>36</b>]
    For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?
    <br />[<b>37</b>] For what can a man give in return for his life?
    <br />[<b>38</b>] For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this
    adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of man also be
    ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."
    <br />
    <hr />
    <h3>Mark.9</h3>
    [<b>1</b>] And he said to them, "Truly, I say to you, there are some
    standing here who will not taste death before they see that the kingdom of
    God has come with power." <br />[<b>2</b>]
    <p>
      And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led
      them up a high mountain apart by themselves; and he was transfigured
      before them,
    </p>
    <br />[<b>3</b>] and his garments became glistening, intensely white, as no
    fuller on earth could bleach them. <br />[<b>4</b>] And there appeared to
    them Eli'jah with Moses; and they were talking to Jesus. <br />[<b>5</b>]
    And Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is well that we are here; let us make
    three booths, one for you and one for Moses and one for Eli'jah."
    <br />[<b>6</b>] For he did not know what to say, for they were exceedingly
    afraid. <br />[<b>7</b>] And a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out
    of the cloud, "This is my beloved Son; listen to him." <br />[<b>8</b>] And
    suddenly looking around they no longer saw any one with them but Jesus only.
    <br />[<b>9</b>]
    <p>
      And as they were coming down the mountain, he charged them to tell no one
      what they had seen, until the Son of man should have risen from the dead.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>10</b>] So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what
    the rising from the dead meant. <br />[<b>11</b>] And they asked him, "Why
    do the scribes say that first Eli'jah must come?" <br />[<b>12</b>] And he
    said to them, "Eli'jah does come first to restore all things; and how is it
    written of the Son of man, that he should suffer many things and be treated
    with contempt? <br />[<b>13</b>] But I tell you that Eli'jah has come, and
    they did to him whatever they pleased, as it is written of him."
    <br />[<b>14</b>]
    <p>
      And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd about them,
      and scribes arguing with them.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>15</b>] And immediately all the crowd, when they saw him, were
    greatly amazed, and ran up to him and greeted him. <br />[<b>16</b>] And he
    asked them, "What are you discussing with them?" <br />[<b>17</b>] And one
    of the crowd answered him, "Teacher, I brought my son to you, for he has a
    dumb spirit; <br />[<b>18</b>] and wherever it seizes him, it dashes him
    down; and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid; and I asked your
    disciples to cast it out, and they were not able." <br />[<b>19</b>] And he
    answered them, "O faithless generation, how long am I to be with you? How
    long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me." <br />[<b>20</b>] And they
    brought the boy to him; and when the spirit saw him, immediately it
    convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at
    the mouth. <br />[<b>21</b>] And Jesus asked his father, "How long has he
    had this?" And he said, "From childhood. <br />[<b>22</b>] And it has often
    cast him into the fire and into the water, to destroy him; but if you can do
    anything, have pity on us and help us." <br />[<b>23</b>] And Jesus said to
    him, "If you can! All things are possible to him who believes."
    <br />[<b>24</b>] Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, "I
    believe; help my unbelief!" <br />[<b>25</b>] And when Jesus saw that a
    crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it,
    "You dumb and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter
    him again." <br />[<b>26</b>] And after crying out and convulsing him
    terribly, it came out, and the boy was like a corpse; so that most of them
    said, "He is dead." <br />[<b>27</b>] But Jesus took him by the hand and
    lifted him up, and he arose. <br />[<b>28</b>] And when he had entered the
    house, his disciples asked him privately, "Why could we not cast it out?"
    <br />[<b>29</b>] And he said to them, "This kind cannot be driven out by
    anything but prayer." <br />[<b>30</b>]
    <p>
      They went on from there and passed through Galilee. And he would not have
      any one know it;
    </p>
    <br />[<b>31</b>] for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, "The
    Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him;
    and when he is killed, after three days he will rise." <br />[<b>32</b>] But
    they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid to ask him.
    <br />[<b>33</b>]
    <p>
      And they came to Caper'na-um; and when he was in the house he asked them,
      "What were you discussing on the way?"
    </p>
    <br />[<b>34</b>] But they were silent; for on the way they had discussed
    with one another who was the greatest. <br />[<b>35</b>] And he sat down and
    called the twelve; and he said to them, "If any one would be first, he must
    be last of all and servant of all." <br />[<b>36</b>] And he took a child,
    and put him in the midst of them; and taking him in his arms, he said to
    them, <br />[<b>37</b>] "Whoever receives one such child in my name receives
    me; and whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me."
    <br />[<b>38</b>]
    <p>
      John said to him, "Teacher, we saw a man casting out demons in your name,
      and we forbade him, because he was not following us."
    </p>
    <br />[<b>39</b>] But Jesus said, "Do not forbid him; for no one who does a
    mighty work in my name will be able soon after to speak evil of me.
    <br />[<b>40</b>] For he that is not against us is for us. <br />[<b>41</b>]
    For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because
    you bear the name of Christ, will by no means lose his reward.
    <br />[<b>42</b>]
    <p>
      "Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it
      would be better for him if a great millstone were hung round his neck and
      he were thrown into the sea.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>43</b>] And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off; it is
    better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go to hell, to
    the unquenchable fire. <br />[<b>45</b>] And if your foot causes you to sin,
    cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be
    thrown into hell. <br />[<b>47</b>] And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck
    it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than
    with two eyes to be thrown into hell, <br />[<b>48</b>] where their worm
    does not die, and the fire is not quenched. <br />[<b>49</b>] For every one
    will be salted with fire. <br />[<b>50</b>] Salt is good; but if the salt
    has lost its saltness, how will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and
    be at peace with one another." <br />
    <hr />
    <h3>Mark.10</h3>
    [<b>1</b>]
    <p>
      And he left there and went to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan,
      and crowds gathered to him again; and again, as his custom was, he taught
      them.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>2</b>]
    <p>
      And Pharisees came up and in order to test him asked, "Is it lawful for a
      man to divorce his wife?"
    </p>
    <br />[<b>3</b>] He answered them, "What did Moses command you?"
    <br />[<b>4</b>] They said, "Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of
    divorce, and to put her away." <br />[<b>5</b>] But Jesus said to them, "For
    your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment. <br />[<b>6</b>] But
    from the beginning of creation, `God made them male and female.'
    <br />[<b>7</b>] `For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother
    and be joined to his wife, <br />[<b>8</b>] and the two shall become one
    flesh.' So they are no longer two but one flesh. <br />[<b>9</b>] What
    therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder."
    <br />[<b>10</b>]
    <p>And in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter.</p>
    <br />[<b>11</b>] And he said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife and
    marries another, commits adultery against her; <br />[<b>12</b>] and if she
    divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery."
    <br />[<b>13</b>]
    <p>
      And they were bringing children to him, that he might touch them; and the
      disciples rebuked them.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>14</b>] But when Jesus saw it he was indignant, and said to them,
    "Let the children come to me, do not hinder them; for to such belongs the
    kingdom of God. <br />[<b>15</b>] Truly, I say to you, whoever does not
    receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it."
    <br />[<b>16</b>] And he took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his
    hands upon them. <br />[<b>17</b>]
    <p>
      And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before
      him, and asked him, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal
      life?"
    </p>
    <br />[<b>18</b>] And Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is
    good but God alone. <br />[<b>19</b>] You know the commandments: `Do not
    kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do
    not defraud, Honor your father and mother.'" <br />[<b>20</b>] And he said
    to him, "Teacher, all these I have observed from my youth."
    <br />[<b>21</b>] And Jesus looking upon him loved him, and said to him,
    "You lack one thing; go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you
    will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me." <br />[<b>22</b>] At
    that saying his countenance fell, and he went away sorrowful; for he had
    great possessions. <br />[<b>23</b>]
    <p>
      And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it will be
      for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!"
    </p>
    <br />[<b>24</b>] And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said
    to them again, "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!
    <br />[<b>25</b>] It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
    than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God." <br />[<b>26</b>] And they
    were exceedingly astonished, and said to him, "Then who can be saved?"
    <br />[<b>27</b>] Jesus looked at them and said, "With men it is impossible,
    but not with God; for all things are possible with God." <br />[<b>28</b>]
    Peter began to say to him, "Lo, we have left everything and followed you."
    <br />[<b>29</b>] Jesus said, "Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has
    left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands,
    for my sake and for the gospel, <br />[<b>30</b>] who will not receive a
    hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers
    and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal
    life. <br />[<b>31</b>] But many that are first will be last, and the last
    first." <br />[<b>32</b>]
    <p>
      And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking
      ahead of them; and they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid.
      And taking the twelve again, he began to tell them what was to happen to
      him,
    </p>
    <br />[<b>33</b>] saying, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son
    of man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will
    condemn him to death, and deliver him to the Gentiles; <br />[<b>34</b>] and
    they will mock him, and spit upon him, and scourge him, and kill him; and
    after three days he will rise." <br />[<b>35</b>]
    <p>
      And James and John, the sons of Zeb'edee, came forward to him, and said to
      him, "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you."
    </p>
    <br />[<b>36</b>] And he said to them, "What do you want me to do for you?"
    <br />[<b>37</b>] And they said to him, "Grant us to sit, one at your right
    hand and one at your left, in your glory." <br />[<b>38</b>] But Jesus said
    to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup
    that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?"
    <br />[<b>39</b>] And they said to him, "We are able." And Jesus said to
    them, "The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism with which
    I am baptized, you will be baptized; <br />[<b>40</b>] but to sit at my
    right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom
    it has been prepared." <br />[<b>41</b>] And when the ten heard it, they
    began to be indignant at James and John. <br />[<b>42</b>] And Jesus called
    them to him and said to them, "You know that those who are supposed to rule
    over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority
    over them. <br />[<b>43</b>] But it shall not be so among you; but whoever
    would be great among you must be your servant, <br />[<b>44</b>] and whoever
    would be first among you must be slave of all. <br />[<b>45</b>] For the Son
    of man also came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a
    ransom for many." <br />[<b>46</b>]
    <p>
      And they came to Jericho; and as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples
      and a great multitude, Bartimae'us, a blind beggar, the son of Timae'us,
      was sitting by the roadside.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>47</b>] And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began
    to cry out and say, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
    <br />[<b>48</b>] And many rebuked him, telling him to be silent; but he
    cried out all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!" <br />[<b>49</b>]
    And Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." And they called the blind man,
    saying to him, "Take heart; rise, he is calling you." <br />[<b>50</b>] And
    throwing off his mantle he sprang up and came to Jesus. <br />[<b>51</b>]
    And Jesus said to him, "What do you want me to do for you?" And the blind
    man said to him, "Master, let me receive my sight." <br />[<b>52</b>] And
    Jesus said to him, "Go your way; your faith has made you well." And
    immediately he received his sight and followed him on the way. <br />
    <hr />
    <h3>Mark.11</h3>
    [<b>1</b>]
    <p>
      And when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Beth'phage and Bethany, at the
      Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
    </p>
    <br />[<b>2</b>] and said to them, "Go into the village opposite you, and
    immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied, on which no one has
    ever sat; untie it and bring it. <br />[<b>3</b>] If any one says to you,
    `Why are you doing this?' say, `The Lord has need of it and will send it
    back here immediately.'" <br />[<b>4</b>] And they went away, and found a
    colt tied at the door out in the open street; and they untied it.
    <br />[<b>5</b>] And those who stood there said to them, "What are you
    doing, untying the colt?" <br />[<b>6</b>] And they told them what Jesus had
    said; and they let them go. <br />[<b>7</b>] And they brought the colt to
    Jesus, and threw their garments on it; and he sat upon it. <br />[<b>8</b>]
    And many spread their garments on the road, and others spread leafy branches
    which they had cut from the fields. <br />[<b>9</b>] And those who went
    before and those who followed cried out, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes
    in the name of the Lord! <br />[<b>10</b>] Blessed is the kingdom of our
    father David that is coming! Hosanna in the highest!" <br />[<b>11</b>]
    <p>
      And he entered Jerusalem, and went into the temple; and when he had looked
      round at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with
      the twelve.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>12</b>]
    <p>On the following day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry.</p>
    <br />[<b>13</b>] And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to
    see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing
    but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. <br />[<b>14</b>] And he
    said to it, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." And his disciples
    heard it. <br />[<b>15</b>]
    <p>
      And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive
      out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and he overturned
      the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons;
    </p>
    <br />[<b>16</b>] and he would not allow any one to carry anything through
    the temple. <br />[<b>17</b>] And he taught, and said to them, "Is it not
    written, `My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations'?
    But you have made it a den of robbers." <br />[<b>18</b>] And the chief
    priests and the scribes heard it and sought a way to destroy him; for they
    feared him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.
    <br />[<b>19</b>] And when evening came they went out of the city.
    <br />[<b>20</b>]
    <p>
      As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away to
      its roots.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>21</b>] And Peter remembered and said to him, "Master, look! The
    fig tree which you cursed has withered." <br />[<b>22</b>] And Jesus
    answered them, "Have faith in God. <br />[<b>23</b>] Truly, I say to you,
    whoever says to this mountain, `Be taken up and cast into the sea,' and does
    not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it
    will be done for him. <br />[<b>24</b>] Therefore I tell you, whatever you
    ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.
    <br />[<b>25</b>] And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have
    anything against any one; so that your Father also who is in heaven may
    forgive you your trespasses." <br />[<b>27</b>]
    <p>
      And they came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, the
      chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to him,
    </p>
    <br />[<b>28</b>] and they said to him, "By what authority are you doing
    these things, or who gave you this authority to do them?" <br />[<b>29</b>]
    Jesus said to them, "I will ask you a question; answer me, and I will tell
    you by what authority I do these things. <br />[<b>30</b>] Was the baptism
    of John from heaven or from men? Answer me." <br />[<b>31</b>] And they
    argued with one another, "If we say, `From heaven,' he will say, `Why then
    did you not believe him?' <br />[<b>32</b>] But shall we say, `From men'?"
    -- they were afraid of the people, for all held that John was a real
    prophet. <br />[<b>33</b>] So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And
    Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these
    things." <br />
    <hr />
    <h3>Mark.12</h3>
    [<b>1</b>]
    <p>
      And he began to speak to them in parables. "A man planted a vineyard, and
      set a hedge around it, and dug a pit for the wine press, and built a
      tower, and let it out to tenants, and went into another country.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>2</b>] When the time came, he sent a servant to the tenants, to
    get from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. <br />[<b>3</b>] And they
    took him and beat him, and sent him away empty-handed. <br />[<b>4</b>]
    Again he sent to them another servant, and they wounded him in the head, and
    treated him shamefully. <br />[<b>5</b>] And he sent another, and him they
    killed; and so with many others, some they beat and some they killed.
    <br />[<b>6</b>] He had still one other, a beloved son; finally he sent him
    to them, saying, `They will respect my son.' <br />[<b>7</b>] But those
    tenants said to one another, `This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and
    the inheritance will be ours.' <br />[<b>8</b>] And they took him and killed
    him, and cast him out of the vineyard. <br />[<b>9</b>] What will the owner
    of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants, and give the
    vineyard to others. <br />[<b>10</b>] Have you not read this scripture: `The
    very stone which the builders rejected<br />
    has become the head of the corner;<br />[<b>11</b>] this was the Lord's
    doing,<br />
    and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"<br />[<b>12</b>]
    <p>
      And they tried to arrest him, but feared the multitude, for they perceived
      that he had told the parable against them; so they left him and went away.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>13</b>]
    <p>
      And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and some of the Hero'di-ans, to
      entrap him in his talk.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>14</b>] And they came and said to him, "Teacher, we know that you
    are true, and care for no man; for you do not regard the position of men,
    but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
    <br />[<b>15</b>] Should we pay them, or should we not?" But knowing their
    hypocrisy, he said to them, "Why put me to the test? Bring me a coin, and
    let me look at it." <br />[<b>16</b>] And they brought one. And he said to
    them, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?" They said to him,
    "Caesar's." <br />[<b>17</b>] Jesus said to them, "Render to Caesar the
    things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." And they
    were amazed at him. <br />[<b>18</b>]
    <p>
      And Sad'ducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection; and
      they asked him a question, saying,
    </p>
    <br />[<b>19</b>] "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies
    and leaves a wife, but leaves no child, the man must take the wife, and
    raise up children for his brother. <br />[<b>20</b>] There were seven
    brothers; the first took a wife, and when he died left no children;
    <br />[<b>21</b>] and the second took her, and died, leaving no children;
    and the third likewise; <br />[<b>22</b>] and the seven left no children.
    Last of all the woman also died. <br />[<b>23</b>] In the resurrection whose
    wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife." <br />[<b>24</b>]
    <p>
      Jesus said to them, "Is not this why you are wrong, that you know neither
      the scriptures nor the power of God?
    </p>
    <br />[<b>25</b>] For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor
    are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. <br />[<b>26</b>] And
    as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the
    passage about the bush, how God said to him, `I am the God of Abraham, and
    the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? <br />[<b>27</b>] He is not God of
    the dead, but of the living; you are quite wrong." <br />[<b>28</b>]
    <p>
      And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another,
      and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, "Which commandment is
      the first of all?"
    </p>
    <br />[<b>29</b>] Jesus answered, "The first is, `Hear, O Israel: The Lord
    our God, the Lord is one; <br />[<b>30</b>] and you shall love the Lord your
    God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and
    with all your strength.' <br />[<b>31</b>] The second is this, `You shall
    love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than
    these." <br />[<b>32</b>] And the scribe said to him, "You are right,
    Teacher; you have truly said that he is one, and there is no other but he;
    <br />[<b>33</b>] and to love him with all the heart, and with all the
    understanding, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as
    oneself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."
    <br />[<b>34</b>] And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to
    him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." And after that no one dared
    to ask him any question. <br />[<b>35</b>]
    <p>
      And as Jesus taught in the temple, he said, "How can the scribes say that
      the Christ is the son of David?
    </p>
    <br />[<b>36</b>] David himself, inspired by the Holy Spirit, declared, `The
    Lord said to my Lord,<br />
    Sit at my right hand,<br />
    till I put thy enemies under thy feet.'<br />[<b>37</b>] David himself calls
    him Lord; so how is he his son?" And the great throng heard him gladly.
    <br />[<b>38</b>]
    <p>
      And in his teaching he said, "Beware of the scribes, who like to go about
      in long robes, and to have salutations in the market places
    </p>
    <br />[<b>39</b>] and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of
    honor at feasts, <br />[<b>40</b>] who devour widows' houses and for a
    pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation."
    <br />[<b>41</b>]
    <p>
      And he sat down opposite the treasury, and watched the multitude putting
      money into the treasury. Many rich people put in large sums.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>42</b>] And a poor widow came, and put in two copper coins, which
    make a penny. <br />[<b>43</b>] And he called his disciples to him, and said
    to them, "Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all
    those who are contributing to the treasury. <br />[<b>44</b>] For they all
    contributed out of their abundance; but she out of her poverty has put in
    everything she had, her whole living." <br />
    <hr />
    <h3>Mark.13</h3>
    [<b>1</b>]
    <p>
      And as he came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Look,
      Teacher, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!"
    </p>
    <br />[<b>2</b>] And Jesus said to him, "Do you see these great buildings?
    There will not be left here one stone upon another, that will not be thrown
    down." <br />[<b>3</b>]
    <p>
      And as he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James
      and John and Andrew asked him privately,
    </p>
    <br />[<b>4</b>] "Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign when
    these things are all to be accomplished?" <br />[<b>5</b>] And Jesus began
    to say to them, "Take heed that no one leads you astray. <br />[<b>6</b>]
    Many will come in my name, saying, `I am he!' and they will lead many
    astray. <br />[<b>7</b>] And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do
    not be alarmed; this must take place, but the end is not yet.
    <br />[<b>8</b>] For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against
    kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places, there will be famines;
    this is but the beginning of the birth-pangs. <br />[<b>9</b>]
    <p>
      "But take heed to yourselves; for they will deliver you up to councils;
      and you will be beaten in synagogues; and you will stand before governors
      and kings for my sake, to bear testimony before them.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>10</b>] And the gospel must first be preached to all nations.
    <br />[<b>11</b>] And when they bring you to trial and deliver you up, do
    not be anxious beforehand what you are to say; but say whatever is given you
    in that hour, for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.
    <br />[<b>12</b>] And brother will deliver up brother to death, and the
    father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put
    to death; <br />[<b>13</b>] and you will be hated by all for my name's sake.
    But he who endures to the end will be saved. <br />[<b>14</b>]
    <p>
      "But when you see the desolating sacrilege set up where it ought not to be
      (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the
      mountains;
    </p>
    <br />[<b>15</b>] let him who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter his
    house, to take anything away; <br />[<b>16</b>] and let him who is in the
    field not turn back to take his mantle. <br />[<b>17</b>] And alas for those
    who are with child and for those who give suck in those days!
    <br />[<b>18</b>] Pray that it may not happen in winter. <br />[<b>19</b>]
    For in those days there will be such tribulation as has not been from the
    beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will be.
    <br />[<b>20</b>] And if the Lord had not shortened the days, no human being
    would be saved; but for the sake of the elect, whom he chose, he shortened
    the days. <br />[<b>21</b>] And then if any one says to you, `Look, here is
    the Christ!' or `Look, there he is!' do not believe it. <br />[<b>22</b>]
    False Christs and false prophets will arise and show signs and wonders, to
    lead astray, if possible, the elect. <br />[<b>23</b>] But take heed; I have
    told you all things beforehand. <br />[<b>24</b>]
    <p>
      "But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and
      the moon will not give its light,
    </p>
    <br />[<b>25</b>] and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers
    in the heavens will be shaken. <br />[<b>26</b>] And then they will see the
    Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory. <br />[<b>27</b>]
    And then he will send out the angels, and gather his elect from the four
    winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven. <br />[<b>28</b>]
    <p>
      "From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender
      and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>29</b>] So also, when you see these things taking place, you know
    that he is near, at the very gates. <br />[<b>30</b>] Truly, I say to you,
    this generation will not pass away before all these things take place.
    <br />[<b>31</b>] Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not
    pass away. <br />[<b>32</b>]
    <p>
      "But of that day or that hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven,
      nor the Son, but only the Father.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>33</b>] Take heed, watch; for you do not know when the time will
    come. <br />[<b>34</b>] It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves
    home and puts his servants in charge, each with his work, and commands the
    doorkeeper to be on the watch. <br />[<b>35</b>] Watch therefore -- for you
    do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening, or at
    midnight, or at cockcrow, or in the morning -- <br />[<b>36</b>] lest he
    come suddenly and find you asleep. <br />[<b>37</b>] And what I say to you I
    say to all: Watch." <br />
    <hr />
    <h3>Mark.14</h3>
    [<b>1</b>]
    <p>
      It was now two days before the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread.
      And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to arrest him by
      stealth, and kill him;
    </p>
    <br />[<b>2</b>] for they said, "Not during the feast, lest there be a
    tumult of the people." <br />[<b>3</b>]
    <p>
      And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at
      table, a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very
      costly, and she broke the flask and poured it over his head.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>4</b>] But there were some who said to themselves indignantly,
    "Why was the ointment thus wasted? <br />[<b>5</b>] For this ointment might
    have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor."
    And they reproached her. <br />[<b>6</b>] But Jesus said, "Let her alone;
    why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.
    <br />[<b>7</b>] For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you
    will, you can do good to them; but you will not always have me.
    <br />[<b>8</b>] She has done what she could; she has anointed my body
    beforehand for burying. <br />[<b>9</b>] And truly, I say to you, wherever
    the gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will be told in
    memory of her." <br />[<b>10</b>]
    <p>
      Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests
      in order to betray him to them.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>11</b>] And when they heard it they were glad, and promised to
    give him money. And he sought an opportunity to betray him.
    <br />[<b>12</b>]
    <p>
      And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the
      passover lamb, his disciples said to him, "Where will you have us go and
      prepare for you to eat the passover?"
    </p>
    <br />[<b>13</b>] And he sent two of his disciples, and said to them, "Go
    into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him,
    <br />[<b>14</b>] and wherever he enters, say to the householder, `The
    Teacher says, Where is my guest room, where I am to eat the passover with my
    disciples?' <br />[<b>15</b>] And he will show you a large upper room
    furnished and ready; there prepare for us." <br />[<b>16</b>] And the
    disciples set out and went to the city, and found it as he had told them;
    and they prepared the passover. <br />[<b>17</b>]
    <p>And when it was evening he came with the twelve.</p>
    <br />[<b>18</b>] And as they were at table eating, Jesus said, "Truly, I
    say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me."
    <br />[<b>19</b>] They began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one after
    another, "Is it I?" <br />[<b>20</b>] He said to them, "It is one of the
    twelve, one who is dipping bread into the dish with me. <br />[<b>21</b>]
    For the Son of man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom
    the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had
    not been born." <br />[<b>22</b>]
    <p>
      And as they were eating, he took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and
      gave it to them, and said, "Take; this is my body."
    </p>
    <br />[<b>23</b>] And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it
    to them, and they all drank of it. <br />[<b>24</b>] And he said to them,
    "This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.
    <br />[<b>25</b>] Truly, I say to you, I shall not drink again of the fruit
    of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God."
    <br />[<b>26</b>]
    <p>And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</p>
    <br />[<b>27</b>] And Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away; for it is
    written, `I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'
    <br />[<b>28</b>] But after I am raised up, I will go before you to
    Galilee." <br />[<b>29</b>] Peter said to him, "Even though they all fall
    away, I will not." <br />[<b>30</b>] And Jesus said to him, "Truly, I say to
    you, this very night, before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three
    times." <br />[<b>31</b>] But he said vehemently, "If I must die with you, I
    will not deny you." And they all said the same. <br />[<b>32</b>]
    <p>
      And they went to a place which was called Gethsem'ane; and he said to his
      disciples, "Sit here, while I pray."
    </p>
    <br />[<b>33</b>] And he took with him Peter and James and John, and began
    to be greatly distressed and troubled. <br />[<b>34</b>] And he said to
    them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch."
    <br />[<b>35</b>] And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and
    prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
    <br />[<b>36</b>] And he said, "Abba, Father, all things are possible to
    thee; remove this cup from me; yet not what I will, but what thou wilt."
    <br />[<b>37</b>] And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter,
    "Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour? <br />[<b>38</b>]
    Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is
    willing, but the flesh is weak." <br />[<b>39</b>] And again he went away
    and prayed, saying the same words. <br />[<b>40</b>] And again he came and
    found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know
    what to answer him. <br />[<b>41</b>] And he came the third time, and said
    to them, "Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is enough; the
    hour has come; the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
    <br />[<b>42</b>] Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand."
    <br />[<b>43</b>]
    <p>
      And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the
      twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests
      and the scribes and the elders.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>44</b>] Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, "The one I
    shall kiss is the man; seize him and lead him away under guard."
    <br />[<b>45</b>] And when he came, he went up to him at once, and said,
    "Master!" And he kissed him. <br />[<b>46</b>] And they laid hands on him
    and seized him. <br />[<b>47</b>] But one of those who stood by drew his
    sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear.
    <br />[<b>48</b>] And Jesus said to them, "Have you come out as against a
    robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? <br />[<b>49</b>] Day after day
    I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But let the
    scriptures be fulfilled." <br />[<b>50</b>] And they all forsook him, and
    fled. <br />[<b>51</b>]
    <p>
      And a young man followed him, with nothing but a linen cloth about his
      body; and they seized him,
    </p>
    <br />[<b>52</b>] but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked.
    <br />[<b>53</b>]
    <p>
      And they led Jesus to the high priest; and all the chief priests and the
      elders and the scribes were assembled.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>54</b>] And Peter had followed him at a distance, right into the
    courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the guards, and
    warming himself at the fire. <br />[<b>55</b>] Now the chief priests and the
    whole council sought testimony against Jesus to put him to death; but they
    found none. <br />[<b>56</b>] For many bore false witness against him, and
    their witness did not agree. <br />[<b>57</b>] And some stood up and bore
    false witness against him, saying, <br />[<b>58</b>] "We heard him say, `I
    will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will
    build another, not made with hands.'" <br />[<b>59</b>] Yet not even so did
    their testimony agree. <br />[<b>60</b>] And the high priest stood up in the
    midst, and asked Jesus, "Have you no answer to make? What is it that these
    men testify against you?" <br />[<b>61</b>] But he was silent and made no
    answer. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the
    Blessed?" <br />[<b>62</b>] And Jesus said, "I am; and you will see the Son
    of man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of
    heaven." <br />[<b>63</b>] And the high priest tore his garments, and said,
    "Why do we still need witnesses? <br />[<b>64</b>] You have heard his
    blasphemy. What is your decision?" And they all condemned him as deserving
    death. <br />[<b>65</b>] And some began to spit on him, and to cover his
    face, and to strike him, saying to him, "Prophesy!" And the guards received
    him with blows. <br />[<b>66</b>]
    <p>
      And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the maids of the high
      priest came;
    </p>
    <br />[<b>67</b>] and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and
    said, "You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus." <br />[<b>68</b>] But he
    denied it, saying, "I neither know nor understand what you mean." And he
    went out into the gateway. <br />[<b>69</b>] And the maid saw him, and began
    again to say to the bystanders, "This man is one of them." <br />[<b>70</b>]
    But again he denied it. And after a little while again the bystanders said
    to Peter, "Certainly you are one of them; for you are a Galilean."
    <br />[<b>71</b>] But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, "I
    do not know this man of whom you speak." <br />[<b>72</b>] And immediately
    the cock crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to
    him, "Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times." And he
    broke down and wept. <br />
    <hr />
    <h3>Mark.15</h3>
    [<b>1</b>]
    <p>
      And as soon as it was morning the chief priests, with the elders and
      scribes, and the whole council held a consultation; and they bound Jesus
      and led him away and delivered him to Pilate.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>2</b>] And Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And
    he answered him, "You have said so." <br />[<b>3</b>] And the chief priests
    accused him of many things. <br />[<b>4</b>] And Pilate again asked him,
    "Have you no answer to make? See how many charges they bring against you."
    <br />[<b>5</b>] But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate wondered.
    <br />[<b>6</b>]
    <p>
      Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they
      asked.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>7</b>] And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in
    the insurrection, there was a man called Barab'bas. <br />[<b>8</b>] And the
    crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he was wont to do for them.
    <br />[<b>9</b>] And he answered them, "Do you want me to release for you
    the King of the Jews?" <br />[<b>10</b>] For he perceived that it was out of
    envy that the chief priests had delivered him up. <br />[<b>11</b>] But the
    chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barab'bas
    instead. <br />[<b>12</b>] And Pilate again said to them, "Then what shall I
    do with the man whom you call the King of the Jews?" <br />[<b>13</b>] And
    they cried out again, "Crucify him." <br />[<b>14</b>] And Pilate said to
    them, "Why, what evil has he done?" But they shouted all the more, "Crucify
    him." <br />[<b>15</b>] So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released
    for them Barab'bas; and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be
    crucified. <br />[<b>16</b>]
    <p>
      And the soldiers led him away inside the palace (that is, the praetorium);
      and they called together the whole battalion.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>17</b>] And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and plaiting a
    crown of thorns they put it on him. <br />[<b>18</b>] And they began to
    salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!" <br />[<b>19</b>] And they struck his
    head with a reed, and spat upon him, and they knelt down in homage to him.
    <br />[<b>20</b>] And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the
    purple cloak, and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to
    crucify him. <br />[<b>21</b>]
    <p>
      And they compelled a passer-by, Simon of Cyre'ne, who was coming in from
      the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>22</b>] And they brought him to the place called Gol'gotha (which
    means the place of a skull). <br />[<b>23</b>] And they offered him wine
    mingled with myrrh; but he did not take it. <br />[<b>24</b>] And they
    crucified him, and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them,
    to decide what each should take. <br />[<b>25</b>] And it was the third
    hour, when they crucified him. <br />[<b>26</b>] And the inscription of the
    charge against him read, "The King of the Jews." <br />[<b>27</b>] And with
    him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.
    <br />[<b>29</b>] And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads,
    and saying, "Aha! You who would destroy the temple and build it in three
    days, <br />[<b>30</b>] save yourself, and come down from the cross!"
    <br />[<b>31</b>] So also the chief priests mocked him to one another with
    the scribes, saying, "He saved others; he cannot save himself.
    <br />[<b>32</b>] Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the
    cross, that we may see and believe." Those who were crucified with him also
    reviled him. <br />[<b>33</b>]
    <p>
      And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land
      until the ninth hour.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>34</b>] And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,
    "E'lo-i, E'lo-i, la'ma sabach-tha'ni?" which means, "My God, my God, why
    hast thou forsaken me?" <br />[<b>35</b>] And some of the bystanders hearing
    it said, "Behold, he is calling Eli'jah." <br />[<b>36</b>] And one ran and,
    filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed and gave it to him to
    drink, saying, "Wait, let us see whether Eli'jah will come to take him
    down." <br />[<b>37</b>] And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed his
    last. <br />[<b>38</b>] And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from
    top to bottom. <br />[<b>39</b>] And when the centurion, who stood facing
    him, saw that he thus breathed his last, he said, "Truly this man was the
    Son of God!" <br />[<b>40</b>]
    <p>
      There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary
      Mag'dalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and
      Salo'me,
    </p>
    <br />[<b>41</b>] who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered
    to him; and also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.
    <br />[<b>42</b>]
    <p>
      And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is,
      the day before the sabbath,
    </p>
    <br />[<b>43</b>] Joseph of Arimathe'a, a respected member of the council,
    who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, took courage and went
    to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. <br />[<b>44</b>] And Pilate
    wondered if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him
    whether he was already dead. <br />[<b>45</b>] And when he learned from the
    centurion that he was dead, he granted the body to Joseph. <br />[<b>46</b>]
    And he bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen
    shroud, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock; and he
    rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. <br />[<b>47</b>] Mary
    Mag'dalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid. <br />
    <hr />
    <h3>Mark.16</h3>
    [<b>1</b>]
    <p>
      And when the sabbath was past, Mary Mag'dalene, and Mary the mother of
      James, and Salo'me, bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>2</b>] And very early on the first day of the week they went to
    the tomb when the sun had risen. <br />[<b>3</b>] And they were saying to
    one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the
    tomb?" <br />[<b>4</b>] And looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled
    back; -- it was very large. <br />[<b>5</b>] And entering the tomb, they saw
    a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe; and they
    were amazed. <br />[<b>6</b>] And he said to them, "Do not be amazed; you
    seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen, he is not here; see
    the place where they laid him. <br />[<b>7</b>] But go, tell his disciples
    and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him, as
    he told you." <br />[<b>8</b>] And they went out and fled from the tomb; for
    trembling and astonishment had come upon them; and they said nothing to any
    one, for they were afraid. <br />[<b>9</b>]
    <p>
      Now when he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to
      Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>10</b>] She went and told those who had been with him, as they
    mourned and wept. <br />[<b>11</b>] But when they heard that he was alive
    and had been seen by her, they would not believe it. <br />[<b>12</b>]
    <p>
      After this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were
      walking into the country.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>13</b>] And they went back and told the rest, but they did not
    believe them. <br />[<b>14</b>]
    <p>
      Afterward he appeared to the eleven themselves as they sat at table; and
      he upbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they
      had not believed those who saw him after he had risen.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>15</b>] And he said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the
    gospel to the whole creation. <br />[<b>16</b>] He who believes and is
    baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.
    <br />[<b>17</b>] And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my
    name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;
    <br />[<b>18</b>] they will pick up serpents, and if they drink any deadly
    thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and
    they will recover." <br />[<b>19</b>]
    <p>
      So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into
      heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.
    </p>
    <br />[<b>20</b>] And they went forth and preached everywhere, while the
    Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that attended
    it. Amen. <br />
